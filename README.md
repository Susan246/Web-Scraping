# Web-Scraping

This project involves web scraping election-related data from  online sources to gather comprehensive information about Nepali elections. The project consists of several tasks:

Task 1: Archiving PEP (Politically Exposed Person) details from the Local Election 2079, Nepal. This includes scraping data such as country, election name, province, district, municipality, ward, position, party name, and received votes.

Task 2: Archiving voters' details from the Local Election 2079, Nepal. This involves scraping voters' details such as country, election name, province, district, municipality, total population, number of wards, election center, number of male voters, number of female              voters, number of other voters, and total eligible voters.

Task 3: Archiving PEP details from the Parliament Election 2079, Nepal. This includes scraping data such as country, election name, province, district, constituency number, candidate name, and received votes from both the 2079 and 2074 elections.

Task 4: Archiving PEP details from the Provincial Election 2079, Nepal. Similar to Task#3, this involves scraping data such as country, election name, province, district, constituency number, candidate name, and received votes from both the 2079 and 2074 elections.

The final deliverables include a MySQL table dump file named 'vote_details.sql' , a Jupyter notebook containing the code used to complete the tasks, and an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) report validating the results by counts of local levels and constituencies as listed on the Wikipedia page for Nepal's constituencies.
